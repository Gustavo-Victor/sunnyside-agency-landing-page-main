## 🛠 My process

### Built with

The following tools were used in the construction of the project:

#### Languages
- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/HTML)
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS)
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - Mobile-first workflow
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) 

#### Utilities 
- **Fonts**:
  - [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow)
  - [Fraunces](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces)

### 🥇 What I learned

During the project development I could learn more about mobile first and flexbox using CSS.

### ⏪ Continued development

To continue this project, I would recommend trying to develop the other pages on the site and also trying to implement the Grid layout instead of just using the flexbox layout, as I think it would be an interesting challenge for you to train your skills.
